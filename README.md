# PyThon-ChessMachine
A work in progress implementation of the minimax algorithm in a PyGame based chess board.
Currently the algorithm works with a depth of 1, I'm in the process of implementing multithreading to speed up the board evaluation and minimax algorithm so the machine can play better chess...
